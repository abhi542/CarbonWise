## 🌳About Codewise🌳

 The CodeWise app aims to explore and develop solutions by helping individuals calculate their monthly carbon footprint based on their lifestyle choices. The app then suggests the number of trees to plant to offset their carbon footprint, encouraging sustainable living practices for a more environmentally conscious world.

Through these efforts, the goal is to encourage sustainable living practices that contribute to a more environmentally conscious and responsible global community.

## 🛠️Project Steps
#### 🧩Backend Development:
1. **Data Handling with Pandas:**
   - Used Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

2. **NumPy for Numeric Operations:**
   - Leveraged NumPy for numerical operations and array manipulation.

3. **Machine Learning with scikit-learn:**
   - Implemented machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn. 

4. **IO Operations:**
   - Utilized the 'io' library for handling input/output operations. 

5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Used Matplotlib for creating visualizations.

6. **Image Processing with Pillow:**
   - Implemented image processing using the Pillow library.

7. **Base64 Encoding/Decoding:**
   - Used base64 for encoding and decoding binary image data.

#### 🖥️Frontend Development:

1. **Streamlit Setup:**
   - Used Streamlit for creating web application.

2. **User Interface Design:**
   - Designed an intuitive user interface using Streamlit components, CSS and Javascript.

3. **Testing:**
